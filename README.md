# *Computer Vision - Pose Detection*

In this project, we will detect the pose.
Pose estimation is a computer vision technique to track the movements of a person or an object. This is usually performed by finding the location of key points for the given objects. Based on these key points we can compare various movements and postures and draw insights. Pose estimation is actively used in the field of augmented reality, animation, gaming, and robotics.

Using packages like **opencv** and **mediapipe**, we were able to extract poses from videos
